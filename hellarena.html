            <p class="my-3">Hell Arena is a top-down 2D run and gun game that was made in Processing for our game design/programming class. I took heavy inspiration from Doom for this.
              Since this was a solo project I did all of the game design, programming, and art assets myself.

            <p>Hell Arena was made as a solo project for the introductory Digital Games course in the IAT program. The requirement was that every game must use the Processing language.
              I used standard OOP methodology to program the game, especially inheritance and polymorphism. I also worked on a game proposal document for the game to demonstrate our theory
            of game design that we learned in the class. Taking a page from Marc LeBlanc's 8 Types of Fun, some of the fun types included:</p>
            <p><ul>
              <li>•	Fantasy - The game setting is horror/action fighting against demons</li>
              <li>•	Sensation - The game will have fast-paced, visceral elements like a top-down shooter</li>
              <li>•	Challenge - The game will be fast-paced and require reflexes</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>We were asked to do rough sketches and a draft design proposal for the game. It helped a lot with envisioning what I wanted out of the game and it kept feature creep in check.
              I had a UML diagram made of objects and the functions that each enemy, weapon or game object would inherit. I had time to implement 5 of the 8 enemies in the design document
              in fact but having the functions and code structure laid out ahead of time helped a lot.

              Afterwards I started working on the code and programming. The game objects including enemies, weapons and the player were all squares and circles as stand-ins before I made the art assets. I wanted
              to get the gameplay functioning and working from start to finish.



            </p>

            <p>
              After the programming was more or less finished I started working in art and sound assets. The sound assets were from Doom and the art assets I made in Illustrator.

            <p>I'm pretty satisfied with how the game turned out. It was the first time I've made a game and I was able to use the programming skills I've picked up over the years.
              I learned a few skills working on this game:
            </p>

            <p><ul><li>Breaking down the code on how basic AIs work</li>
            <li>Working with simple trigonometry to figure out mouse aiming and movement</li>
            <li>Using inheritance and polymorphism</li>
            <li>Collision detection</li>
            <li>Practicing basic illustrations for the art assets</li>
          <li>Coding and designing a basic game loop</li></ul></p>
