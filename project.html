            <p class="my-3">For Freedom is a 4-player board game where players take on the role of runaway slaves
              attempting to escape to Arlington, Virgina to Freedman’s Village – a haven populated by former slaves.
              Players must survive for 5 days, each day coming with its own randomly drawn event card that players must
              resolve together by choosing up to 5 different decisions listed on the event card.

              For Freedom was for a board game project that revolved around the concept of Serious Fun – using games and
              entertainment as a medium to teach and educate about real-life issues, history, and dilemmas. These types
              of games are usually more serious than People Fun games like Jenga or Cards Against Humanity where it is
              more about social interactions.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5 h2-alpha90">Process</h2>
          <p>The brainstorming process was more difficult than the previous People Fun game project we did because we
            had to consider what kind of real-life issues or serious narratives we wanted to tell. We had a good idea
            of what kind of gameplay we wanted – a type of survival roleplaying game where your characters’ choices
            could mean life or death. We set during the Wild West at first, since the lawlessness of the era made it
            easier to justify why your character could be killed through careless resource management.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5 h2-alpha90">Problem</h2>
          <p>The gameplay was well received by our friends and family but in the official playtesting session with the
            rest of the class our feedback told us that it did not have enough narrative and it took the issue of
            slavery a bit too light-hearted.
            After this we did some brainstorm and researching – I looked through articles on slavery and life in the
            American Civil War period and found out some interesting things about slavery – for example, the existence
            of slave towns which we would end up using the real-life Freedman's Village in Arlington, Virginia as the
            players’ destination for the game.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5 h2-alpha90">Result</h2>

          <p>When we replaced some of the narrative description of our event cards with more historical accuracy and
            added character biographies to the playable characters it was well-liked. I gained a lot of experience on
            how to use peer feedback to improve your projects and it was great to have those eureka moments when
            someone indirectly solves a problem for you with their feedback.</p>
            <p>Some of the skills I've learned and used working on this project include:</p>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Using brainstorming techniques like rapid ideation, mind mapping for our concept</li>
                <li>Deliberating mechanics and why and how to add them to instill a certain tone or atmosphere for the game</li>
                <li>Working with playtesters and directing playtesting sessions</li>
                <li>Using feedback to improve our game</li>
                <li>Creating a map and minor illustrations for the game using Adobe Illustrator</li>
