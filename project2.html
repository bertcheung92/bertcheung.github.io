            <p class="my-3">Into the Paintscape is a visual novel created in the open-source Ren'Py engine. It was the
              result of a group term project for our Interactive Narrative class. Our story was inspired by the French
              Surrealism art style and it tells the story of Nia, a photographer who looks for her missing friend Selene
              who's trapped inside the worlds of her paintings.</p>

            <p>Since we were expected to provide a more serious narrative Christine and I looked at events in real-life
              to serve as an inspiration and foundation for our story. It was originally just myself and Christine as
              the team where I would function as the writer, programmer and gameplay designer while Christine would
              focus work on the art and writing.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-5 h2-alpha90">Problem</h2>
            <p>Halfway through the term we added Aspen to our team. This was because we needed another person to help
              divide the workload and we also liked some of her artwork. Since she was working on a fantasy medieval
              narrative before we recruited her and Christine and I were not set on the story yet we had to overcome a
              writing block and choose between two contrasting tones/narratives. What kind of story, and what kind of
              setting did we want to tell? We didn't know yet.</p>
          </div>

      <section class="div-spacer">
        <div class="row justify-content-between">
          <div class="col-sm-6 order-md-2 order-1">
            <h2 class="mb-5 h2-alpha90">Result</h2>

            <p>The three of us had brainstorming sessions to come to a decision on our narrative. We tried to merge the
              fantasy medieval setting of Aspen's narrative with the plot and story of someone searching for her friend,
              but ultimately we decided to stick with the modern day setting we had in mind. That also meant scrapping
              most, if not all of Aspen's narrative designs. It was a hard decision but we did it in order to have a
              stronger focus and not make it seem like a forced blending between two different genres and settings. It
              was also important to keep the scope of the project reasonable since having a fantasy setting would mean
              more sketching and brainstorming when it could be used for getting the project done. In the end adding
              Aspen was a great choice since the workload was split better and we were able to manage our time and
              sanity in the semester.</p>

              <p>Some of the skills I've learned and used working on this project include:</p>

              <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Brainstorming and writing a narrative with branching choices and multiple endings</li>
                <li>Using past programming and scripting experience to pick up Ren'Py within a semester</li>
                <li>Using Ren'Py's triggers and scripting system to create dialogue and a visual novel experience including sounds, music, narrative choices and puzzles</li>
                <li>Working with the team on art direction and integrating art assets</li>

              </ul></p>
