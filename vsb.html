            <h2 class="mb-5 h2-alpha90">Process</h2>
            <p>Our course was given a semester to prepare and film a 5 minute microdocumentary on any subject we wanted. We formed groups and started on pre-production right away.
              Our original idea was to interview an old folk and film it as part of a contest entry for old folk's experiences. We changed our minds as I proposed we do an interview
            with Kenny Lam, owner of Vancouver Street Battle instead. </p>

            <p>Based in Richmond, VSB is a fighting game venue that hosts tournaments and casual sessions for the local fighting game community and as part of Vancouver's 
              fighting game community I wanted to give back to the community and VSB after being able to make so many friends and good experiences there.
            </p>

            <p>We spent 5-7 days working on dailies and interview footage. The interview footage was the easiest to get, and dailies were the meat of our work as we
              filmed on location at Vancouver Street Battle when they were hosting tournaments.  Footage was filmed with the SFU Library's T3i Canon - handheld footage was
              shot with a steadicam grip.

            <p>I liked how our video turned out! If there was one thing I wish I could improve on it would've been the steadicam footage. The steadicam grip we used needed a very 
              precise way of balancing the weights and clamps so that the camera would remain steady. I'm sure if I had more time to practice setting up the steadicam grip and getting 
              more footage with it the video would turn out even better. Our team learned a lot about the production process of a video, and if I was asked to make a video I would be 
              more than confident in my new abilities and from my experience working in this project.
            </p>

            <p>Some of the skills I've used include:</p>

            <p><ul><li>Coordinating and working with key subjects and location scheduling</li>
            <li>Writing the story structure and storyboarding important details and events</li>
            <li>Using theory learned in previous photography courses to set up 3-key lighting for the main interview</li>
            <li>Shooting an interview and dailies</li>
            <li>Organizing and editing raw footage together</li>
            <li>Meeting daily to discuss how to trim a video into 5-minutes with so many important interview beats</li>
            <li>Post-production work including animated graphics, color grading, and sound mixing</li></ul></p>
